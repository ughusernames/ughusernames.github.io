          <p>Cousin Steve's Burger Bin has been in business for nearly four decades. With a long history like that you might expect them to be good at their craft. Unfortunately they are not, until now. In the last four weeks I have eaten 30 of their tornado burgers. With a habenero brioche bun, 1/4000th of a ton of pepperjack, their secret 14 veggie ketchup, and a blend of flyover state animals in the patty, this is perhaps my favorite burger of all time. Congratulations Steve, you finally made a good burger.</p>

        <p>Pete is an artisan, while the Cow Sandwich is plain, it does meat right.</p>
